   <h1>Introduction To GIS</h1>
		<h2>What is GIS?</h2>
			<p>As an emerging technology itself, the field of geographic information systems (GIS) is constantly evolving.  Over a span of twenty years, members of the geographic information community have seen this technology advance from command line, workstation-based software to tools that can now be used in the cloud and via mobile devices.</p>
		<h2>So, What is GIS?</h2> 
			<p>This is probably the most asked question posed to those in the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) field and is probably the hardest to answer in a succinct and clear manner. GIS is a technological field that incorporates geographical features with tabular data in order to map, analyze, and assess real-world problems. <br><br>

			The key word to this technology is Geography – this means that some portion of the data is spatial.  In other words, data that is in some way referenced to locations on the earth. Coupled with this data is usually tabular data known as attribute data.  Attribute data can be generally defined as additional information about each of the spatial features.  An example of this would be schools. The actual location of the schools is the spatial data.  Additional data such as the school name, level of education taught, student capacity would make up the attribute data.  It is the partnership of these two data types that enables GIS to be such an effective problem solving tool through spatial analysis.<br><br>

			GIS operates on many levels.  On the most basic level, geographic information systems technology is used as computer cartography, that is for straight forward mapping. The real power of GIS is through using spatial and statistical methods to analyze attribute and geographic information.  The end result of the analysis can be derivative information, interpolated information or prioritized information.</p>
		<h2>GIS Versus Geospatial</h2>

			<p>There is an increasing trend to use the term geospatial instead of GIS.  What is the difference between geospatial and GIS?  Although some may use the terms interchangeably, there is a distinct difference between the two in that GIS refers more narrowly to the traditional definition of using layers of geographic data to produce spatial analysis and derivative maps.  Geospatial is more broadly use to refer to all technologies and applications of geographic data.  For example, popular social media sites such as Foursquare and Facebook use “check-ins” that allow their users the ability to geographically tag their statuses.  While those applications are considered to be geospatial, they don’t fall underneath the stricter definition of what makes up a geographic information system.</p>
		<h2>Other quotes to answer “What is GIS?”</h2>

			<p>“In the strictest sense, a GIS is a computer system capable of assembling, storing, manipulating, and displaying geographically referenced information, i.e. data identified according to their locations. Practitioners also regard the total GIS as including operating personnel and the data that go into the system.” ~ USGS“</p>
			<p>A geographic information system (GIS) is a computer-based tool for mapping and analyzing things that exist and events that happen on earth. GIS technology integrates common database operations such as query and statistical analysis with the unique visualization and geographic analysis benefits offered by maps.” ~ Esri</p>
			<p>“GIS is an integrated system of computer hardware, software, and trained personnel linking topographic, demographic, utility, facility, image and other resource data that is geographically referenced.” ~ NASA </p>
			<p>“A geographic information system is a special case of information systems where the database consists of observations on spatially distributed features, activities or events, which are definable in space as points, lines, or areas. A geographic information system manipulates data about these points, lines, and areas to retrieve data for ad hoc queries and analyses” (Kenneth Dueker,Portland State University, 1979).</p>
			<p>GIS has already affected most of us in some way without us even realizing it. If you’ve ever used an Internet mapping program to find directions, congratulations, you’ve personally used GIS. The new supermarket chain on the corner was probably located using GIS to determine the most effective place to meet customer demand.</p>
		<h2>Uses of GIS </h2>
			<p>There are numerous ways in which GIS is used across different industries.  A few examples are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Emergency response teams normally use GIS when they want to collect logistics with regards to how they will move in times of natural disasters.</li>
				<li>The system also comes in handy when authorities want to discover any potential wetlands that need to be protected from the harmful effects brought about by pollution.</li>
				<li>Companies also take advantage of the GIS so that they may be able to choose a strategic market location that has not yet been saturated by other competitors in the particular niche industry.</li>
				<li>Management personnel use this system also so that they can be able to locate areas that are bound to suffer from catastrophes with regards to the infrastructure that is in place there.</li>
				<li>Any potential spread of diseases & other such like pandemic are usually limited by the use of the GIS since the patterns of their occurrence is predicted in sufficient time.</li>
			</ol>
		<h2>A Short History of GIS</h2>
			<p>One of the most famous early examples of spatial analysis can be traced back to London in the year 1854 when Dr. John Snow was able to predict the occurrence of cholera outbreak (More: John Snow’s Cholera Map using GIS Data). Thanks to the study that Snow released, officials from the government were able to determine the cause of the disease; which was contaminated water from one of the major pumps. The map that Snow came up with was very interesting in that it had the capability of analyzing the phenomena relating to their geographical positions and this was the first time the world was witnessing this. Photozincography was developed in the earlier years of the 1900s and this enabled the maps to be divided into various layers as required. In the initial stages, the process of drawing these maps was lengthy since it involved free hand but this changed later on with the introduction of the computer.</p> <br>

			<p>The first GIS was created by Dr. Roger Tomlinson and then introduced in the early 1960s in Canada. During its inception, this system was mainly meant for collecting, storing and then analyzing the capability & potential which the land in the rural areas had. Prior to this, mapping by the use of computers was being used for such cases but this is a method that had numerous limitations associated to it. By the end of the 80s period, the use of GIS had already become popular in other related fields which is why it led to a spur in the growth of the industrial sector. Recently, designers came up with open source software for GIS so that the brilliant technology can be enhanced in a much simpler manner while being made available to all.</p>
