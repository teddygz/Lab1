	<h1>Components of GIS</h1>
			<p>The next step in understanding GIS is to look at each area and how they work together.  These components are:</p>
				<ol>
				<li>Hardware</li>
				<li>Software</li>
				<li>Data</li>
				<li>People</li> </ol>
		<h2>Hardware</h2>
			<p>Hardware comprises the equipment needed to support the many activities needed for geospatial analysis ranging from data collection to data analysis. For desktop GIS, the central piece of equipment is the workstation, which runs the GIS software and is the attachment point for ancillary equipment. The use of handheld field technology and mobile GIS is also becoming an important data collection tool in GIS. With the advent of web mapping, web servers have also become an important piece of equipment.</p><br>
		<h2>Software</h2>
			<p>Different types of software are important. Central to this is the GIS application package. Such software is essential for creating, editing and analyzing spatial and attribute data, therefore these packages contain a myriad of geospatial functions inherent to them. Extensions or add-ons are software that extends the capabilities of the GIS software package. Component GIS software is the opposite of application software. Component GIS seeks to build software applications that meet a specific purpose and thus are limited in their spatial analysis capabilities. Utilities are stand-alone programs that perform a specific function. For example, a file format utility that converts from on type of GIS file to another. There is also web GIS software that helps serve data and interactive maps through Internet browsers.</p><br>
		<h2>Data</h2>
			<p>Data is the core of any GIS. There are two primary types of data that are used in GIS: vector and raster data. A geodatabase is a database that is in some way referenced to locations on the earth. Geodatabases are grouped into two different types: vector and raster. Vector data is spatial data represented as points, lines and polygons.  Raster data is cell-based data such as aerial imagery and digital elevation models.  Coupled with this data is usually data known as attribute data.  Attribute data generally defined as additional information about each spatial feature housed in tabular format.</p><br>

				<caption>In a GIS, each piece of data contains a geographic location and attributes that describe it. &nbsp;The red dot on the map is a Fortune 1000 company headquarter and the attributes are displayed in the information window.</caption></div>
			<p>Documentation of GIS datasets is known as metadata.  Metadata contains such information as the coordinate system, when the data was created, when it was last updated, who created it and how to contact them and definitions for any of the code attribute data.</p><br>
			<p>There are many different ways that GIS data can be collected.  Head up digitizing (the process of tracing GIS data directly on the screen), LiDAR, drones, GPS, and satellites are some of the ways GIS data is created.</p> <br>

		<h2>People</h2>
			<p>Well-trained GIS professionals knowledgeable in spatial analysis and skilled in using GIS software are essential to the GIS process (More: Building a GIS Career). There are three factors to the people component: education, career path, and networking. The right education is key; taking the right combination of classes.  Selecting the right type of GIS job is important.  A person highly skilled in GIS analysis should not seek a job as a GIS developer if they havenâ€™t taken the necessary programming classes.  Finally, continuous networking with other GIS professionals is essential for the exchange of ideas as well as a support community.</p> <br>
